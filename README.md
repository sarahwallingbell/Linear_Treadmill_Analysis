# Linear_Treadmill_Analysis
Analyzes Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) walking kinematics on a linear treadmill. 

Paremeters: 
1) CSV files of tracked fly behavior reconstructed in 3D using Anipose. 
2) Metadata files with treadmill belt speed.

Analyses:
- duty factor 
- heading angle
- leg phase offsets
- leg trajectories
- legs in stance
- static stability 
- step amplitude
- step duration 
- step frequency
- step height 
- swing stance plots
- velocity
